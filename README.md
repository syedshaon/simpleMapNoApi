Simple google map plugin for WordPress as the name suggests it is a map plugin that uses google's embeed map functionality.      
This plugin doesn't require google map's api to load the map.      
However this plugin have limited functionality you have to find the location's logitude and latitude by yourself to work it properly.         
Also you have to put the "Marker Title" to show it up in map page.      
You can have all this functionality or ever better by using google map's website (https://www.google.com/maps) but I wanted to have a tricky plugin that anyone can use to have a map with less complexity.
