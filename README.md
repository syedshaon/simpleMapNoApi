# simpleMapNoApi
Simple Google map plugin for WordPress that is 100% responsive and doesn't require google map api.
This is a very simple plugin that used google's embeed map feature. I added 1 extra function that is "showing Location title" in the map.

How To Use:

To use this plugin, first download it from WordPress plugins directory or from here.
Install and activate it.
You will see and option named "Map Options" in WordPress admin dashboard.
From there you can put specific location's latitude, longitude, Marker Title, width, height as you want.
If you don't specify any width then it will use 100% of available width.
To find a location's latitude and longitude use google map.
